  "desc": "This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for facial emotion recognition using transfer learning and custom CNNs. By leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG16, ResNet50, and EfficientNet, the model are fine-tuned to classify emotions from facial images into predefined categories.",
